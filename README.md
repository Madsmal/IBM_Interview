# IBM_Interview


This project allows a user to login into an application where it is possible to logout or change the password of the user. The application is connected to a MySQL database where different queries will be run from Java and executed in MySQL. It is possible to create users, change passwords and login. 

0) Git clone project: https://github.com/Madsmal/IBM_Interview.

1) Add external jars "mysql-connector-java-8.0.13.jar" and "togglz-core-2.6.1.Final.jar" to build path in IDE. 

2) Run main.java (jdk12 used for this project).  


Due to time constraints, Togglz did not get fully implemented but the base method is added. The idea was to use Togglz for implementing Toggle features such that certain users could access different resources without deploying new code. Most of the time was spent on setting up the Java environment, MySQL and different dependencies. Total time used = ~5 hours \

For this project, Java was chosen as the programming language even though this could have been possible in other languages/frameworks as well. The main reason behind this is because I have had experience with Java Swing before which made it easier to create a basic UI. While I have done most of my recent programming in Python and C#, the syntax does not differ a lot and the logic is pretty much the same. \
